# random_passwords_generator

## Introduction
`A random number password generator written in Python, also it will generate his hash form.` 
<br />

Minimum 14 characters are required and the new passwords are compared with a .txt file containing the most common passwords, if it is the same as one of those, it will be discarded. I have not downloaded the rockyou.txt file because of his dimension, but a reduced one. You can find the official rockyou file <a href="https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br />
  
Furthermore, the new passwords and all their hash forms will be saved in a new file. ![This is an image]./images/newfile.png
